title: Points (Elliptic Curves)
---

A critical feature of the Bitcoin protocol is ECDSA, or elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. ECDSA is based on elliptic curves, which are groups over a finite field. This group consists of points. Points can be added together (the group operation) and multiplied by big numbers (applying the group operation a large number of times). They use modulus arithmetic and wrap around. The group is cyclic and generated by the base point G.

```typescript
const G = Point.getG()
```
