title: Script
---

Bitcoin transactions consist of inputs and outputs. A transaction can have one or more inputs and one or more outputs. Each input must spend bitcoin from an output from an earlier transaction. If an output has not yet been spent, it is called an "unspent output" or UTXO.

Contained inside each input and output is a script. The language itself is called "Script". As Satoshi Nakamoto himself once told us, it probably should have been called a "predicate", which is a statement that evaluates either true or false, but because that word was too long and unfamiliar, he used the word "Script" instead. A script is what is inside inputs and outputs and the language is called "Script" with a capital "S".
